to whom it may concern,

\
justina here. i’m looking for full-time software engineering opportunities and specifically interested in places that have the following traits:

- transparent — clear external and internal communication
- supportive — welcomes feedback and active about change
- goal-oriented — defined long-term strategy

previously, i worked as a data scientist that dabbled in data, machine learning, and engineering at a young startup focused on improving patient outcomes with IVF and improving the patient experience. prior to that, I was traveling, studying, and researching all over the world from biology in boston and berlin, germany to computer science in lausanne, switzerland. I’m passionate about women’s health and an advocate for diversity and minority support in the tech space.
